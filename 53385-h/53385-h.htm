<span class="i0">A cry of terror, a dash, a run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shells came blazing from each gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before an instant hardly passed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dewey back through memory gazed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with his dazzling sword in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whirled it high and gave command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury blazing from his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thundering voice was heard to cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Remember the Maine! Speed! Haste!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be careful, boys, no shells to waste.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered we our blood did run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent shells flying from our gun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our boats, like burning Vesuvius seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out our guns shells poured and streamed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directed by an immortal eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not a strayward shell did fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But each of the shells from the guns that went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performed the mission on which ’twas sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our captain took his glass in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o’er the battle quickly scanned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Stop the guns,” he quickly cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Fortune now is on our side;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To bake mud cakes more water she’ demand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ed quickly brought and placed it at her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all their play they were not seen to pout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Always in love there was no falling out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day to school they hand in hand would go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her books and slate Ed carried to and fro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each Sunday morn the chapel bell would chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ed with Alice marched away on time;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To church at night Alice alone he’d bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from one book both in the choir would sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The childish love that bound them when at play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greater love soon yielded up its sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were children once, but ah, no children now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ed was a farmer, master of the plow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alice, a maid, how skilful at the loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all affairs pertaining to the home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once close they lived, but now three miles apart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But miles cannot divide true heart from heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61"></a>{61}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village lads loved well the maiden dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knew their love and would not interfere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hand in hand through life they always went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lovingly, so happy, so content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ah, if he had known the pain to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have had her safely in his home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Avia came a family seeking health;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noble family; great, too, was their wealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man and wife, a son, the darling joy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John his name, and handsome was the boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the maid, and love came at the sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win her love he sought with all his might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon she loved John and soon he loved the maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So swift is love when gold can give it aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And since that day the youth came from the north<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ed’s cloak of love had keenly felt a moth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E’er on his face there dwelt a heavy frown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day he passed his head was hanging down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the village wondered as he passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What made the change, what made him so downcast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each Sunday morn he strolled alone to church;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>{62}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sympathized&mdash;we knew it grieved him much;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the ivy from the oak we tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemeth lonely, ah! it seemeth bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ’twas with Ed when they were seen apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed e’er sad, so withered was his heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loved her still, and each time he would call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He plead in vain that she would love him all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each night Ed called each night both lovers met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They’d try in vain each other to outset.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on her face Ed read her heart’s desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He’d ask his hat, reluctantly retire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Ed, from youth could see her any time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now once a week his visits were confined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each youth desired the maid to be his bride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She loved them both, and how could she decide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three months had passed&mdash;the choice she had not made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bashful face she sought her mother’s aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hinted out the burden of her heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her loving mother knew the other part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Oh, Ed and John,” she said, with trembling voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a>{63}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I love them both and cannot make a choice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three months in vain the choice I’ve tried to make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s left with you mother, which one to take.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother thought awhile and slowly said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I cannot choose the man for you to wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For much is in the saying of the bard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Make your own bed and keep it if it’s hard;’<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So make your choice; if he’s not what he seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On no one else can you well place the blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I’m your ma, advice ’tis mine to give:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whom you choose through life pray try to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they who wed and quit without a cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have broken o’er our Holy Father’s laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you can for him lay down your life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, my child, consent to be his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For married life is greater than a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all have found it greater than it seemed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know the one whose love is pure and best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think it right to bring him to a test.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can you judge from the word the greater love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does rain tell all that it has seen above?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What steed an empty wagon cannot pull?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, place him to a wagon that is full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many words! but, ah, the simple few,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a>{64}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can have a great effect if spoken true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetest words make not the greatest youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, he is great who sayest but the truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world to-day is so enrapt with sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it is right with women and with men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they be exalted in our sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must have great assurance they are right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Ed and John seem good, I love them well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one for you to choose I cannot tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way to find the one to suit you best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put life at stake and give them both a test,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he who takes a maiden for his wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should count it joy to give for her his life.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew that neither Ed nor John could swim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try the deep would be a test for them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought how each of them enjoyed to row.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said: “Some day, while rowing, drop your oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell him bring the oar you’ll be his bride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First let the oar ’neath the boat be tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engage them now, go quick and tie the oar.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One came at three, the other came at four.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feign to tell them what the mother said;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great the plot when by a woman made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a>{65}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She set the time, and John and Ed complied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evening came and John was by her side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With John she goes, as though she loved him best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out in the boat that she his love might test.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From youth she knew the art to dive and swim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas all a secret, ’t was not known to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached the deep where angry billows roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She for a purpose dropped her only oar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out from the boat the oar the waves did toss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid screamed out in anguish, “We are lost!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oar was fairly whirling by a wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The frightened maid knelt praying God to save.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coward youth sat trembling pale as death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face had changed, it seemed he had no breath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid knelt still, pretending loud to weep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through her fingers at the youth she’d peep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw the youth still fainting in dismay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would have laughed, but thought she would betray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raised her head, the oar again she spied;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a>{66}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the boat the oar with cord was tied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She really cried, for lo! her face was red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“John, bring the oar, I’ll be your wife,” she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But John sat still, for he could not obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I cannot swim,” was all she heard him say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bade him think, she bade him count the cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Without the oar won’t both our lives be lost?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you sit here is death not sure?” she said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John knew it was, and cowardly dropped his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling voice she cried, imploring still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Go, bring the oar; if you won’t, John, I will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will you do?” She paused to give him time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not go; she leaped into the brine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sank and rose, and loudly came a sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Pray come and help! quick! love, for soon I drown!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John saw his love the third time disappear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cried in vain, for John refused to steer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again she rose and quickly seized the oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the boat the oar she swiftly bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon in the boat, dripping, she took her seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As John sat cowardly gazing at her feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67"></a>{67}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the shore she quickly made her way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reached the shore, to him was heard to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The oar wasn’t lost; by this thread it was tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life to you I’m thinking to confide.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this she said: “I did it just to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether or not you’re worthy of my love.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She told him all, and said: “John can’t you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you are false and do not care for me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And John stood crying, begging not to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She vowed she’d not, and said to him farewell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went his way and she sat on the beach&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll tell you why before the end is reached&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas nearly four, and Ed, her other beau,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had promised then to meet her for a row.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hour had come, the village clock was heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! Ed was there; he always kept his word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up from the beach she rose, her friend to greet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had not heard the tramping of his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon in the boat they both sat face to face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the oar as though out for a race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with the oar she gave the sea a sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon the boat was sailing on the deep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Here comes a ship; look, Ed, I see the top.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned his head, the oar she did let drop.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a>{68}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Dear Ed,” she cried, “pray take me to my home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dropped the oar and death is sure our doom.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gazed at her and saw her faint away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Don’t cry, my dear,” she softly heard him say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised her head, consoling words he speaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushed back her hair and kissed her rosy cheeks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretended she unconscious of a kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still her soul was thrilled with holy bliss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised her gently in a fond embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gently wipes her tear-stained, blushing face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears upon her rosy cheek repose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared like sparkling dewdrops on a rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men in hurrying pressed for want of time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can find a moment still to sip the wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hurried Ed, for fear the oar he’d miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still found time, yea, thrice, her lips to kiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as a man is moved by sparkling drinks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performs an act before of danger thinks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kiss affected Ed as strongest wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He could not swim, yet did not fear the brine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not stop for once to count the cost,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69"></a>{69}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought he once that either would be lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, unless his queen should reach the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of his arm he would have made an oar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from the boat he leaped, and could not swim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angry wave came quick and covered him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strangled he rose, though struggling for his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cried aloud: “O, God, pray, save my wife!”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not drown, for she well knew the art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaped and bore him speechless to her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold of the cord the oar she quickly drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, brought the oar she said he never knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He really thought he saved his lover’s life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He woke and cried aloud: “You are my wife.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when he sank he was a senseless elf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day he thinks he brought the oar himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she saw how artless was his love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love within her heart was felt to move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there is love much love it doth inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus blazed her love and set his soul on fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70"></a>{70}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed as love her heart would ’sunder rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless by hasty means could give it vent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when love’s heart is free from doubt and fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sayeth much that love would feign to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus went the time until the glowing west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was telling that the sun had gone to rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached the shore, though he was soaking wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they left, the wedding day was set.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three weeks passed on, the blessed eve drew near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wedding bells were chiming loud and clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night they vowed to love and serve through life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There never lived a happier man and wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Mistle still to-day there can be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thatch-roofed house, twined round with ivy green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the lawn a boy and girl at play&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the home where Ed and Alice stay.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
